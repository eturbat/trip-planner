# batfolio-inc-final-project: Trip Planner, A Potassium Group Idea
For the final project of CS320 User Interface, the Batfolio Group were tasked with creating TripPlanner, an one-stop application for all things trip related.

According to The Potassium Group (our client)
‚ÄúThe primary job of this application is to simplify and consolidate the complex and involved process of planning and managing a vacation.‚Äù  

## Motivation

The primary purpose of this application is to simplify the process of trip planning. Through our research and needfinding (see slides in repo for more details), we found that users want an all in one website that takes care of their travel needs. We also realized that travel sites should include information on the most popular tourist attractions and finally: easily accessible and simple to use websites are of a priority to users.
